# Soldier Betrayal Risk Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This notebook contains a machine learning pipeline that predicts the likelihood of soldier betrayal during times of imminent war. The model uses a dataset with soldier-related features such as financial status, loyalty, greed, and satisfaction levels to assess risk. Soldiers with high risk scores are flagged as potential betrayers.

## Data Collection

### `collect_data()`
- **Purpose**: This function simulates collecting soldier data, which in this case is loaded from a CSV file (`soldier_data.csv`). 
- **Output**: A Pandas DataFrame containing soldier information, such as financial status, greedy behavior, loyalty, and other characteristics.

---

## Feature Extraction

### `extract_features(soldier_data)`
- **Purpose**: Extracts meaningful features from the soldier data to calculate the betrayal risk score.
- **Features**:
  - `wealth`: Based on the soldier's financial status.
  - `greed`: Quantified by analyzing the soldier's greedy behavior.
  - `loyalty`: Derived from a loyalty score.
  - `respect`: Based on the soldier's respect for leadership.
  - `discontentment`: Inverted score from the satisfaction level of the soldier.

### Feature Quantification Functions
- **`quantify_wealth(financial_status)`**: Directly uses the financial status as a wealth score.
- **`quantify_greed(greedy_behavior)`**: Directly uses greedy behavior as greed score.
- **`quantify_loyalty(loyalty_score)`**: Directly uses the loyalty score.
- **`quantify_respect(respect_for_leadership)`**: Directly uses respect for leadership.
- **`quantify_discontentment(satisfaction_level)`**: Converts satisfaction level to discontentment (by using `11 - satisfaction_level`).

## Risk Assessment

### `assess_risk(features)`
- **Purpose**: Calculates the risk score for each soldier based on the extracted features. The risk score is computed using a weighted combination of the features.
  - **Formula**:
    ```
    Risk Score = (0.2 * wealth) + (0.3 * greed) + (0.3 * loyalty) + (0.1 * respect) + (0.1 * discontentment)
    ```

### `rank_soldiers(risk_scores)`
- **Purpose**: Ranks soldiers by their risk scores in descending order. Soldiers with higher risk scores are more likely to betray.

---

## Alert System

### `alert_potential_betrayers(ranked_soldiers)`
- **Purpose**: Iterates through the ranked soldiers and alerts for those who have a risk score higher than the defined threshold (`THRESHOLD = 7.0`).
- **Output**: Prints an alert for soldiers whose risk score exceeds the threshold, flagging them as potential betrayers.

---

## Model Training and Evaluation

### `update_model(soldier_data)`
- **Purpose**: Updates the machine learning model based on historical data to improve betrayal prediction accuracy.
- **Model Used**: `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn`.
- **Process**:
  1. Prepares data by extracting features related to betrayal (financial status, greedy behavior, loyalty, etc.).
  2. Splits data into training and testing sets.
  3. Trains a `RandomForestClassifier` on the training set.
  4. Evaluates the model using the test set and prints out a classification report (precision, recall, and F1-score).

## Main Execution Loop

The script runs in a loop, checking if war is imminent through the `war_is_imminent()` function (which is currently hardcoded to always return `True`). Each loop iteration performs the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers the latest soldier data.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts and quantifies relevant features.
3. **Risk Assessment**: Calculates and ranks soldiers based on betrayal risk.
4. **Alert System**: Flags high-risk soldiers for potential betrayal.
5. **Model Update**: Trains and evaluates a machine learning model to predict betrayal based on new data.

---

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
   ```

2. **Prepare Data**:
   - Ensure that the file `soldier_data.csv` is in the same directory. This file should contain the soldier data with the following columns:
     - `id`
     - `financial_status`
     - `greedy_behavior`
     - `loyalty_score`
     - `respect_for_leadership`
     - `satisfaction_level`
     - `betrayed` (for model training)

3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Execute the cells in the notebook to simulate data collection, risk assessment, and model updating.

4. **Customization**:
   - Adjust the threshold score (`THRESHOLD = 7.0`) if needed to fine-tune the betrayal detection sensitivity.

## Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates a risk assessment system that combines rule-based logic with machine learning. It analyzes various features of soldiers and provides alerts for potential betrayers, while continuously improving through an updated machine learning model.
